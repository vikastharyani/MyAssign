Consider a monolithic java application stack. 
Apache Web Server, Apache Tomcat application server with Active MQ and Oracle and MongoDB backend. 
Propose a solution to migrate this application stack to cloud of your choice (AWS/OpenStack/Azure). 
Mention all the provider services you would use and how you would maintain HA and Load Balancing (consider app to be stateless). Mention rationale for each decision.

Apcahe Tomcat - Amazon EC2 Instances with Auto Scaling
Active MQ – AWS SQS or Active MQ
Load balancing – Amazon ELB
